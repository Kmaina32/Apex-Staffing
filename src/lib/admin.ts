// For this prototype, we'll hardcode the admin UIDs.
// In a real application, you might use Firebase Custom Claims for a more robust solution.
//
// How to find your UID:
// 1. Log in to your application.
// 2. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
// 3. Select your project: "global-talent-bridge"
// 4. Navigate to the "Authentication" section.
// 5. You will see a list of users. Copy the UID for your admin user account.
export const ADMIN_USER_IDS = [
  'u3gIVM3UDEXVJ2wt5NkCkr0kvvs2',
  // You can add more admin UIDs here
];
